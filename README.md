# CGPA-Calculator
This is a very basic JavaFX based application that is used to calculate CGPA,<br>
 given GPA and credit values for each semester.<br>
Each GPA and credit value is stored in a local MySQL Database.<br>
The data is then retrieved and the total CGPA is calculated and displayed.<br>
This is a basic project to demonstrate the basics and fundamentals of frontend and backend development as a whole.
